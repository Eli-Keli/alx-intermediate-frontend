To install SASS, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Node.js**: 
    First, you need to have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Install npm (Node Package Manager)**: 
    npm comes with Node.js, so if you have installed Node.js, you already have npm.

3. **Open Command Prompt or Terminal**:
    Navigate to your project directory. In your case, it would be:
    ```
    cd /C:/Users/User/Desktop/ALX ProDev/alx-intermediate-frontend/0x03-sass_scss/0-installation-script
    ```

4. **Install SASS**:
    Run the following command to install SASS globally on your system:
    ```
    npm install -g sass
    ```

5. **Verify Installation**:
    To verify that SASS has been installed correctly, you can run:
    ```
    sass --version
    ```

This will display the version of SASS installed on your system.
